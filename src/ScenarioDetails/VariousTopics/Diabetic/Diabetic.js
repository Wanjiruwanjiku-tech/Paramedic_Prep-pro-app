                        Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period due to either insufficient 
                        insulin production or the bodyâ€™s inability to use insulin effectively. For paramedic students and professionals, 
                        understanding the types of diabetes, their causes, and clinical management is crucial when handling diabetic emergencies. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Diabetic emergencies arise from severe imbalances in blood glucose levels, either too high or too low. These conditions require immediate intervention to prevent long-term damage or death.</p>

                            Hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose level of less than <span className="hi">70 mg/dL</span>.

                            <p>
                            Hypoglycemia occurs when there is too much insulin in the bloodstream relative to the 
                            glucose available, leading to cellular energy deprivation, especially in the brain.
                            </p>

                                <li>Insulin overdose</li>

                                <span className="hi">Conscious Patient:</span> Administer oral glucose (15-20g of fast-acting carbohydrates)
                                Recheck glucose after 15 minutes, repeat glucose administration if still low.<br />

                                DKA results from insulin deficiency, which leads to the breakdown of fat stores into fatty acids. 
                                The liver converts these fatty acids into ketones, leading to acidosis.

                            <p>
                                Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. 
                                As a result, the body produces little or no insulin, which is essential for glucose metabolism.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
                            <p>
                            Insulin is responsible for allowing glucose to enter cells to be used as energy. 
                            Without insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, leading to hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels).
                            Patients with Type 1 diabetes are insulin-dependent for life
                            </p>

                                Most often develops in childhood or adolescence but can occur at any age. 
                                It has a rapid onset with symptoms developing over days or weeks.

                                Patients with Type 1 diabetes require lifelong insulin therapy to manage their blood sugar levels. 
                                They must monitor their blood glucose levels regularly and adjust their insulin doses accordingly.
                            </p>

                                Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. 
                                The body is unable to use insulin effectively, leading to high blood sugar levels.

                            <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
                            <p>
                                Insulin resistance occurs when the body's cells do not respond to insulin properly, leading to high blood sugar levels. 
                                Over time, the pancreas may produce less insulin, further exacerbating the condition.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Common Onset</h3>
                            <p>
                                Most often develops in adults, but it is becoming more common in children and adolescents due to rising obesity rates.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Similar to Type 1 diabetes but may develop more slowly.</li>
                                <li>Often asymptomatic or mild symptoms initially.</li>
                                <li>Increased risk of cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and other complications.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Management</h3>
                            <p>
                                Type 2 diabetes can often be managed through lifestyle changes, including diet, exercise, and weight loss. 
                                Some patients may require oral medications or insulin therapy to control their blood sugar levels.

                            <h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
                            <p>
                                Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and is characterized by high blood sugar levels that develop or are first recognized during pregnancy.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
                            <p>
                                Hormonal changes during pregnancy can lead to insulin resistance, causing blood sugar levels to rise. 
                                In some cases, the pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin to compensate.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Common Onset</h3>
                            <p>
                                Develops during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Often asymptomatic or mild symptoms.</li>
                                <li>Increased risk of complications for both mother and baby.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Management</h3>
                            <p>
                                Gestational diabetes is managed through diet, exercise, and monitoring blood sugar levels. 
                                Some patients may require insulin therapy to control their blood sugar levels during pregnancy.
